NUS Orbital 2025 - Milestone 1
Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Project Gemini 
Motivation: 
Many students and professionals struggle with time management and procrastination. The Pomodoro Technique is a proven method that enhances focus and productivity by breaking work into intervals. However, most existing Pomodoro apps lack integration with task management and progress tracking.

Our application will seamlessly integrate a Pomodoro Timer, To-Do List, and Productivity Analysis to help users stay on track, measure their progress, and optimize their workflow.

Aim: 
We hope to develop a user-friendly Java Application that helps users to stay focused using the Pomodoro technique (25 min work / 5 min rest cycles), organise tasks with a simple To-Do List and track productivity with insights on completed Pomodoro sessions
User Stories: 
As a student, I want to use a Pomodoro Timer to break study sessions into focused intervals, so I can stay productive without burnout.
As a working professional, I want a To-Do List alongside my Pomodoro Timer, so I can manage tasks efficiently.
As a student/working professional, I want to track my completed Pomodoro sessions, so I can analyze my productivity patterns and improve myself.

Scope of Project: 
The Web App provides a Pomodoro Timer Interface for students to time themselves and plan their study for optimal efficiency.

Tech Stack 
JavaFX (FrontEnd)
SQLite (Backend) 

How are we different from similar platforms? 
Task Management
We provide users with the ability to add their tasks into our task management section which helps to prioritise more important tasks and increase users’ efficiency.
Productivity Tracking
The app tracks the productivity of the user by tracking how many breaks and work session the user does.
